This site selects a random show or movie from a list and displays it on the webpage. This is a very simple HTML site that was made out of necessity as neither myself nor my friends ever know what to watch.

This site is hosted using GitHub Pages. You can check it out at [killerkenobi.github.io/whattowatch](https://killerkenobi.github.io/whattowatch/)
