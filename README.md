This site selects a random show or movie from a list and displays it on the webpage. This is a very simple HTML site that was made out of necessity as neither myself nor my friends ever know what to watch.

This site is hosted using GitHub Pages. You can check it out at [killerkenobi.github.io/whattowatch](https://killerkenobi.github.io/whattowatch/)

## Whats Next?
I am planing on making some major changes to the way this website functions. In its current state, this site uses [custom js code](killerkenobi/whattowatch/js/content_randomizer.js) to select a random show or movie from a hard-coded list. In the near future I would like to create a single file responsible for containing the list of shows and movies. This would make updating the list easier and the code cleaner.


I would also like to add some additional functionality to this site. When a user is presented with a random selection, I would like to also display information about the show or movie including viewing platform, ratings, descriptions, etc.

## Personal Use of This Site's Code
Feel free to fork this repo for your own personal use. At this time you can edit the list of shows and movies in the values definition in [content_randomizer.js](killerkenobi/whattowatch/js/content_randomizer.js).
